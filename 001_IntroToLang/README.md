# Introduction to Languages

### Types of Languages

#### Procedural

- Specifies a series well structured steps to compose a program.
- They utilize procedures or routines to execute tasks.
- They emphasize control flow structures like loops and conditionals.
- They are often used for system programming and applications development.
- They are efficient for low-level programming tasks and performance-critical applications.
- Common examples include C, Pascal, and BASIC.

#### Functional

- Focuses on evaluating mathematical functions to perform computation.
- Avoids mutable state and side effects.
- Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data such as ML.
- Suitable for concurrent and parallel programming.
- Examples include Haskell, Clojure, and Erlang.

#### Object-Oriented

- Organizes code around objects that encapsulate data and behavior.
- Code + Data = Object
- Developed to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse, and maintain software.
- Promotes concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Encourages modular design and code organization.
- Commonly used in software development for modeling real-world entities.
- Examples include Java, C++, and Python.
